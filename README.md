Open Source Workout Tracker

I am currently trying to develop a replacement application for my fitness-tracking app.

I've used apps like Hevy, JEFIT, MyFitnessPal, Boostcamp, AI fitness apps, notes apps, and even paper and pen. I've enjoyed bits and pieces from each of these applications but never as a whole. I want to create my version of a workout log tracker, attempting to implement the best of all worlds.  

It has to be simple, easy, adaptive, customizable, reliable, completely free, and respectful of your privacy.

As an amateur one-person team who is an FT student and works PT, it will take some time, and it wouldn't look pretty, but I'm looking for functionality first.

In terms of community development, I am more than open to seeking help along the way. But it's still very early in development, and I'm currently in the design phase. Once I get further down the pipeline, I will be more communicative on community aid with content and possible improvements and features.

I will update once I build more functionality and get a working prototype.
